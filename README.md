# youtube_quick_buttons

Inspired by general youtube annoyance.

It puts no frills "Not Interested" (N) and "Don't recommend channel" (D) buttons at the front, where they belong.

The YT buttons are kinda wanky and require 2 clicks to get to, but well, all YT dev is
wanky so there ya go.

The menu button (3 dots) that supplies the options is the last thing to be rendered to the YT page
and can lag showing up.  My buttons use it and by finding and clicking the menu open and then finding and
clicking the appropriate item. So, mine won't work until theirs is renedered. 

Heavily commented

I don't publish chrome extensions so feel free to do what you like with it.
