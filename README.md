# youtube_quick_buttons

Inspired by general youtube annoyances.

I don't publish chrome extensions so feel free to do what you like with it.

It puts "Not Interested" and "Don't recommend channel" buttons at the front where they belong.

The buttons themselves, as built by yahoo are kinda wanky, but well, all YT dev is wanky so there ya go
