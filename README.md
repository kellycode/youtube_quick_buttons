# youtube_quick_buttons

Inspired by general youtube annoyance.

It puts no frills "Not Interested" (N) and "Don't recommend channel" (D) buttons at the front, where they belong.

The buttons themselves, as built by yahoo are kinda wanky and require 2 clicks to get to, but well, all YT dev is
wanky so there ya go.  In 2022, there's no doing anything correctly, it's all about rush.  Like building a house
quick out of hot-glue and styrofoam, well yeah, I guess ya could but...

The menu button (3 dots) that supplies the menu options is the last thing to be rendered to the YT page
and can lag showing up.  My buttons use it and by finding and clicking the menu open and then finding and
clicking the appropriate item. So, mine won't work until theirs is renedered.
